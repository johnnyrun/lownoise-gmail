# Low Noise Gmail

If you, as me, receive tons of automatic email (monitoring, alarms, agent and boring stuff), your gmail box is out of control in size.

Deleting thousands email is a long, boring, blocking task.

This googlescript delete 500 message at time, and run every 5 minutes.

I gained 50% in size.

You write the query, and the script delete noise messages.

### Install
* Go to https://script.google.com
* “New script”
* Copy paste the code from lng.gs file
* Edit the queries to match unwanted old messages.
* Run --> “Run function” --> Install


Code is released under WTFPL.
